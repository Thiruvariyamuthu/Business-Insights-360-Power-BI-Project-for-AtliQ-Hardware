# 📊 Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project for AtliQ Hardware
End-to-end Power BI project for AtliQ Hardware—finance, sales, marketing, supply chain &amp; executive insights.

🚀 Turning guesswork into data-driven growth

# AtliQ Hardware BI Project

AtliQ Hardware is one of the fastest-growing companies in the electronics market. But their growth journey was built on **gut feelings and assumptions**, which led to costly mistakes—like a failed expansion into Latin America.

That’s when they realized: **data is not optional, it’s essential.**

This project demonstrates how I, as a **Data Analyst**, built an **end-to-end BI solution** to transform AtliQ’s raw data into actionable insights across **Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive reporting**.
